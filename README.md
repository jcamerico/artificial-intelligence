# Artificial intelligence projects

Hi! These are my implementations for the coding exercises proposed by the course CSMM.101x (Artificial Intelligence) on edX.
This repository contains two Python projects:
 - *8-puzzle*: An 8-puzzle solver written using different search algorithms (**BFS**, **DFS**, **A***);
 - *2048*: A 2048 solver written using **minimax** algorithm with **alpha-beta pruning**.
